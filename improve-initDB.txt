Return the database instance: Currently startDB() doesn't return anything, but you'll likely need the database connection for other operations. Return the db instance so it can be used elsewhere.

Make it a Promise: The function is async but doesn't return a Promise. Wrap the database creation in a Promise so you can properly await it and handle errors.

Error handling: Add proper error handling and logging for database connection failures.

Connection management: Consider adding a way to close the database connection when the app shuts down.

Database initialization status: Add a flag or return value to indicate if the database was successfully initialized.

Consistent naming: Since you're calling it startDB(), consider if you want it to be more like initializeDB() or connectDB() to better reflect what it does.
